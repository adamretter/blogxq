    Tokenization and matching might need some
    consideration, too, but could not $x contains text "artery" ftand "plaque" distance at most 3
    words be mapped in a more compact (and less generic) fashion, e.g. along the lines of let $words
    := tokenize($x, " ") return some $i in index-of($words, "artery") satisfies $words[position() =
    ($i - 3 to $i + 3)] = "plaque"
